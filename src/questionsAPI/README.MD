# How to add questions to your database 

1. Choose a category - the 4 in my MVP are listed below, partly chosen as they had 20+ questions to choose from. The category must be listed as its ID number.
2. If needed update the number of questions you would like to pull

```
3. run ts-node "<yourdirectory>/questionsAPI/addQuestions.ts" for every category
```

>[!CAUTION]
The category must be listed as its ID number.
Some categories will not the number of questions needed.
